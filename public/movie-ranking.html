<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>High School Musical</h3>
<p>This movie has very good songs. It is also the beginning of one of the best trilogies in history.</p>

<h3>Mulan</h3>
<p>This was a very well animated movie. It had great songs too and it tells one of the most traditional stories of my people.</p>

<h3>The Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Lots of my favorite characters died in this movie. It made me cry at the theater and moved me.</p>
